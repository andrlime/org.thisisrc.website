## Instructions for Pull Requests and Commits

There are three categories of PRs/commits:

<ol>
<li>code: Use this tag when you're updating code that will affect the website (in other words, all code)</li>
<li>clean: Use this tag when you're cleaning up useless code</li>
<li>doc: Use this tag when you're adding comments or documentation</li>
</ol>
<br/>
That's it.
